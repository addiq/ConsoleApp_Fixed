# ConsoleApp

## What was fixed?
* Main file __Program.cs__: filename at line 15 from data**a**.csv to data.csv
* File __DataReader.cs__:
- Added at lines __24, 49, 85, 96__ ***if*** instruction, which checking NOT 'null or empty' value at strings
* In __data.csv__ was missed one semicolon, so that corrupt correct reading line and inserting values into array at line **40**
